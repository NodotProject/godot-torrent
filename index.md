## üíñ Support Me
Hi! I‚Äôm krazyjakee üéÆ, creator and maintain¬≠er of the *NodotProject* - a suite of open‚Äësource Godot tools (e.g. Nodot, Gedis, GedisQueue etc) that empower game developers to build faster and maintain cleaner code.

I‚Äôm looking for sponsors to help sustain and grow the project: more dev time, better docs, more features, and deeper community support. Your support means more stable, polished tools used by indie makers and studios alike.

Every contribution helps maintain and improve this project. And encourage me to make more projects like this!

*This is optional support. The tool remains free and open-source regardless.*
